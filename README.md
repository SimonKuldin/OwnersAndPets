# OwnersAndPets

I have created an MVC 5 ASP.NET Web Application for this coding challenge.

To access the website the solution will need to be opened in Visual Studio and the OwnersAndPets project is to be run via the Debug menu in any browser that is desired.

The link to the list of owners and their cats can be found via the top menu, Pets -> Cats.
